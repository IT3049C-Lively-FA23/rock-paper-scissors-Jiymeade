## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.
18/20, because I haven't frequently pushed or commited changes I made. 

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
I struggled with finding little error in the coding such as Captilization or `` istead of '' and more. I used the npm test, first would save then test see how much i passed then look in what I need to change like "we wont text" instead of ="button". 


### How long it took us to finish this?
I started 3 days ago, go close then the transition wouldn't work. So, I started over a day later, the name enter screen only to enter but it wouldn't take a name and traansition. Without a name it transition but then it wouldn't play the game if you pick paper it would automatically turn back to rock and not give you if the cpu or user won. Then this morning, with little error in the button and title being fixed; It finally worked.
